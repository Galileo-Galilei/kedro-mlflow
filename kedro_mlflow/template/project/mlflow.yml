# SERVER CONFIGURATION -------------------

# `mlflow_tracking_uri` is the path where the runs will be recorded.
# For more informations, see https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#where-runs-are-recorded
# kedro-mlflow accepts relative path from the project root.
# For instance, default `mlruns` will create a mlruns folder
# at the root of the project

# All credentials needed for mlflow must be stored in credentials .yml as a dict
# they will be exported as environment variable
# If you want to set some credentials,  e.g. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
# > in `credentials.yml`:
# your_mlflow_credentials:
#   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: 132456
#   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: 132456
# > in this file `mlflow.yml`:
# credentials: mlflow_credentials

server:
  mlflow_tracking_uri: null # if null, will use mlflow.get_tracking_uri() as a default
  mlflow_registry_uri: null # if null, mlflow_tracking_uri will be used as mlflow default
  credentials: null  # must be a valid key in credentials.yml which refers to a dict of sensitive mlflow environment variables (password, tokens...). See top of the file.
  request_header_provider: # this is only useful to deal with expiring token, see https://github.com/Galileo-Galilei/kedro-mlflow/issues/357
    type: null # The path to a class : my_project.pipelines.module.MyClass. Should inherit from https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/tracking/request_header/abstract_request_header_provider.py#L4
    pass_context: False # should the class be instantiated with "kedro_context" argument?
    init_kwargs: {} # any kwargs to pass to the class when it is instantiated

tracking:
  # You can specify a list of pipeline names for which tracking will be disabled
  # Running "kedro run --pipeline=<pipeline_name>" will not log parameters
  # in a new mlflow run

  disable_tracking:
    pipelines: []

  experiment:
    name: {{ python_package }}
    restore_if_deleted: True  # if the experiment`name` was previously deleted experiment, should we restore it?

  run:
    id: null # if `id` is None, a new run will be created
    name: null # if `name` is None, pipeline name will be used for the run name
    nested: True  # if `nested` is False, you won't be able to launch sub-runs inside your nodes

  params:
    dict_params:
      flatten: False  # if True, parameter which are dictionary will be splitted in multiple parameters when logged in mlflow, one for each key.
      recursive: True  # Should the dictionary flattening be applied recursively (i.e for nested dictionaries)? Not use if `flatten_dict_params` is False.
      sep: "." # In case of recursive flattening, what separator should be used between the keys? E.g. {hyperaparam1: {p1:1, p2:2}} will be logged as hyperaparam1.p1 and hyperaparam1.p2 in mlflow.
    long_params_strategy: fail # One of ["fail", "tag", "truncate" ] If a parameter is above mlflow limit (currently 250), what should kedro-mlflow do? -> fail, set as a tag instead of a parameter, or truncate it to its 250 first letters?


# UI-RELATED PARAMETERS -----------------

ui:
  port: "5000" # the port to use for the ui. Use mlflow default with 5000.
  host: "127.0.0.1"  # the host to use for the ui. Use mlflow efault of "127.0.0.1".
