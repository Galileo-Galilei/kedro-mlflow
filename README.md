# What is kedro-mlflow?

``kedro-mlflow`` is a [kedro-plugin](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/07_extend_kedro/04_plugins.html) for lightweight and portable integration of [mlflow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html) capabilities inside [kedro](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) projects. It enforces [``Kedro`` principles](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/12_faq/01_faq.html?highlight=principles#what-is-the-philosophy-behind-kedro) to make mlflow usage as production ready as possible. Its core functionalities are :

- **versioning**: `kedro-mlflow` intends to enhance reproducibility for machine learning experimentation. With `kedro-mlflow` installed, you can effortlessly register your parameters or your datasets with minimal configuration in a kedro run. Later, you will be able to browse your runs in the mlflow UI, and retrieve the runs you want. This is directly linked to [Mlflow Tracking](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html).
- **model packaging**: ``kedro-mlflow`` intends to be be an agnostic machine learning framework for people who want to write portable, production ready machine learning pipelines. It offers a convenient API to convert a Kedro pipeline to a ``model`` in the mlflow sense. Consequently, you can *API-fy* or serve your Kedro pipeline with one line of code, or share a model with without worrying of the preprocessing to be made for further use. This is directly linked to [Mlflow Models](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html).

# How do I install kedro-mlflow?

**Important: ``kedro-mlflow`` is only compatible with ``kedro>=0.16.0`` and ``mlflow>=1.0.0``. If you have a project created with an older version of ``Kedro``, see this [migration guide](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/blob/master/RELEASE.md#migration-guide-from-kedro-015-to-016).**

``kedro-mlflow`` is available on PyPI, so you can install it with ``pip``:

```console
pip install kedro-mlflow
```

If you want to use the most up to date version of the package which is under development and not released yet, you can install the package from github:

```console
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/Galileo-Galilei/kedro-mlflow.git
```

I strongly recommend to use ``conda`` (a package manager) to create an environment and to read [``kedro`` installation guide](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/02_get_started/02_install.html).

# Getting started

The documentation contains:

- [A  "hello world" example](https://kedro-mlflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/03_getting_started/index.html) which demonstrates how you to **setup your project**, **version parameters** and **datasets**, and browse your runs in the UI.
- A section for [advanced machine learning versioning](https://kedro-mlflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/04_experimentation_tracking/index.html) to show more advanced features (mlflow configuration through the plugin, package and serve a kedro ``Pipeline``...)
- A section to demonstrate how to use `kedro-mlflow` as a [machine learning framework](https://kedro-mlflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/05_framework_ml/index.html) to deliver production ready pipelines and serve them. This section comes with [an example repo](https://github.com/Galileo-Galilei/kedro-mlflow-tutorial) you can clone and try out.

Some frequently asked questions on more advanced features:

- You want to log additional metrics to the run? -> [Try ``MlflowMetricsDataSet``](https://kedro-mlflow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/source/04_experimentation_tracking/05_version_metrics.html) !
- You want to log nice dataviz of your pipeline that you register with ``MatplotlibWriter``? -> [Try ``MlflowArtifactDataSet`` to log any local files (.png, .pkl, .csv...) *automagically*](https://kedro-mlflow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/source/04_experimentation_tracking/03_version_datasets.html)!
- You want to create easily an API to share your awesome model to anyone? -> [See if ``pipeline_ml_factory`` can fit your needs](https://github.com/Galileo-Galilei/kedro-mlflow/issues/16)
- You want to do something that is not straigthforward with current implementation? Open an issue, and let's see what happens!

# Release and roadmap

The [release history](https://github.com/Galileo-Galilei/kedro-mlflow/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) centralizes packages improvements across time. The main features coming in next releases are [listed on github milestones](https://github.com/Galileo-Galilei/kedro-mlflow/milestones). Feel free to upvote/downvote and discuss prioritization in associated issues.

# Disclaimer

This package is still in active development. We use [SemVer](https://semver.org/) principles to version our releases. Until we reach `1.0.0` milestone, breaking changes will lead to `<minor>` version number increment, while releases which do not introduce breaking changes in the API will lead to `<patch>` version number increment.

The user must be aware that we will not reach `1.0.0` milestone before Kedro does (mlflow has already reached `1.0.0`).

If you want to see how to migrate from one version of `kedro-mlflow` to another, see the [migration guide](https://kedro-mlflow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/source/02_installation/03_migration_guide.html).
