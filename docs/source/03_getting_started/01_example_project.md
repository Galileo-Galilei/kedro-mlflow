# Example project

## Install the plugin in a virtual environment

Create a conda environment and install ``kedro-mlflow`` (this will automatically install ``kedro>=0.16.0``).

```console
conda create -n km_example python=3.6.8 --yes
conda activate km_example
pip install kedro-mlflow==0.7.5
```

## Install the toy project

For this end to end example, we will use the [kedro starter](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/02_get_started/06_starters.html) with the [iris dataset](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-starter-pandas-iris).

We use this project because:

- it covers most of the common use cases
- it is compatible with older version of ``Kedro`` so newcomers are used to it
- it is maintained by ``Kedro`` maintainers and therefore enforces some best practices.

### Installation with ``kedro>=0.16.3``

The default starter is now called "pandas-iris". In a new console, enter:

```console
kedro new --starter=pandas-iris
```

### Installation with ``kedro>=0.16.0, <=0.16.2``

With older versions of ``Kedro``, the starter option is not available, but this ``kedro new`` provides an "Include example" question. Answer ``y`` to this question to get the same starter as above. In a new console, enter:

```console
kedro new
```
