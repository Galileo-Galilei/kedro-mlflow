# GLOBAL CONFIGURATION -------------------

# `mlflow_tracking_uri` is the path where the runs will be recorded.
# For more informations, see https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#where-runs-are-recorded
# kedro-mlflow accepts relative path from the project root.
# For instance, default `mlruns` will create a mlruns folder
# at the root of the project
mlflow_tracking_uri: mlruns

# All credentials needed for mlflow must be stored in credentials .yml as a dict
# they will be exported as environment variable
# If you want to set some credentials,  e.g. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
# > in `credentials.yml`:
# your_mlflow_credentials:
#   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: 132456
#   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: 132456
# > in this file `mlflow.yml`:
# credentials: mlflow_credentials

credentials: null  # must be a valid key in credentials.yml

# EXPERIMENT-RELATED PARAMETERS ----------

# `name` is the name of the experiment (~subfolder
# where the runs are recorded). Change the name to
# switch between different experiments
experiment:
  name: {{ python_package }}
  create: True  # if the specified `name` does not exists, should it be created?


# RUN-RELATED PARAMETERS -----------------

run:
  id: null # if `id` is None, a new run will be created
  name: null # if `name` is None, pipeline name will be used for the run name
  nested: True  # # if `nested` is False, you won't be able to launch sub-runs inside your nodes

hooks:
  node:
    flatten_dict_params: False  # if True, parameter which are dictionary will be splitted in multiple parameters when logged in mlflow, one for each key.
    recursive: True  # Should the dictionary flattening be applied recursively (i.e for nested dictionaries)? Not use if `flatten_dict_params` is False.
    sep: "." # In case of recursive flattening, what separator should be used between the keys? E.g. {hyperaparam1: {p1:1, p2:2}}will be logged as hyperaparam1.p1 and hyperaparam1.p2 oin mlflow.
    long_parameters_strategy: fail # One of ["fail", "tag", "truncate" ] If a parameter is above mlflow limit (currently 250), what should kedro-mlflow do? -> fail, set as a tag instead of a parameter, or truncate it to its 250 first letters?


# UI-RELATED PARAMETERS -----------------

ui:
  port: null  # the port to use for the ui. Find a free port if null.
  host: null  # the host to use for the ui. Default to "localhost" if null.
