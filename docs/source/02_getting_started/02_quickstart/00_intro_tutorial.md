# Goal of the tutorial

This "Getting started" section demonstrates how to use some basic functionalities of `kedro-mlflow` in an end to end example. It is supposed to be simple and self-contained and is partially redundant with other sections, but far from complete.

The **section only focuses on experiment tracking** part and **does _not_ show the "machine learning framework" abilities** of the plugin. The goal is to give to a new user a quick glance to some capabilities so that he can decide whether the plugin suits its needs or not. It is totally worth checking the other sections to have a much more complete overview of what this plugin provides.
