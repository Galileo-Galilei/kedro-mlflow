# Goal of the tutorial

This "Getting started" section demonstrates how to use some basic functionalities of `kedro-mlflow` in an end to end example. It is supposed to be simple and self-contained and is partially redundant with other sections, but far from complete.

The section only focuses on the versioning part and does not show the "machine learning framework" abilities of the plugin. The goal is to give to a new user a quick glance to some capabiltiies so that he can decide whether the plugin suits its needs or not. It is totally worth checking the other sections to have a much more complete overview of what this plugin provides.
